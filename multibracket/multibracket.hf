* Include into a FORM program at a point where declaration statements 
* are allowed to enable the multibracket feature. To use, replace bracket 
* statments with `multibracket' (otherwise exactly the same usage, but +- 
* and abbreviations not allowed) and pass FORM output through the program
* "multibracket". Regular brackets will not be affected.

    function [_MB_];

    #define multibracket "multiply left [_MB_]; bracket [_MB_] "

    #define nmultibracket "id [_MB_] = 1"
